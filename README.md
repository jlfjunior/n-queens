# N Queens Problem

The N Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem in computer science and mathematics. The challenge is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means:

- No two queens can be on the same row.
- No two queens can be on the same column.
- No two queens can be on the same diagonal.

The goal is to find all possible ways (or just one, depending on the implementation) to arrange N queens on the board such that none of these constraints are violated.

## Explanation:
- Row and Column Conflicts: A queen on any square can attack any other queen in the same row or column.
- Diagonal Conflicts: A queen can attack any other queen on the diagonals that extend in both directions from its position.

The N Queens problem is often solved using backtracking, which systematically searches for a solution by placing queens one by one and checking if they can be placed safely. If a queen cannot be placed safely in a row or column, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries a new configuration.

## Special Cases:
- For N = 1, there is one trivial solution (a single queen on the board).
- For N = 2 and N = 3, there is no solution because it is impossible to place two or three queens on the board without violating the rules.
- For N ≥ 4, there are multiple possible solutions.

The problem has applications in areas like constraint satisfaction, optimization, and parallel computing.
